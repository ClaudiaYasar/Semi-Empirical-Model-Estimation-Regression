# Semi-Empirical-Model-Estimation-Regression
This work focuses on semi-empirical model estimation using second-order regression for system identification. An optimizer adjusts parameters to align predictions with measured values by minimizing errors. The goal is to fit predictions to TC Lab's two-heater model data, minimizing the integral absolute error (IAE). Using a 10-minute data collection period with rapid and slow asynchronous (staggered) steps of the heaters with varying magnitudes and directions, the optimizer refines parameters to match model outputs with real-time data.
